Kegbot for Android
===================

Overview
--------
This is a fork of Kegbot For Android. You can (mostly) look at the closed pull requests
for individual tweaks that have been made from the original. 

Main repository: https://github.com/Kegbot/kegbot-android

Developers: Quick Setup Instructions
------------------------------------

- Clone the kegbot-android repo
- Android Studio: Import the project as a gradle project. See ``kegtab/build.gradle`` for sdk versions.

Patches Welcome!
----------------

Ideally we'll pick over the best changes into the main branch. Until then, feel free to build your own.
I'll try to keep a pre-built copy of latest in the releases area but note that it is NOT offical kegbot and thus
will not be able to be installed side-by-side because they share a packge name.
